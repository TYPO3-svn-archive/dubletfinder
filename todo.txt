To-do list for tx_dubletfinder
==============================

Help for this extension is very welcome! Contact the author if you want to help in any way.

If you find any bugs in this extension, please report them in the Typo3 bugtracker under the project tx_dubletfinder.

Development speed of this extension mainly depends on whether it is funded. So if you'd like this extension to get developed quickly (or you need a certain feature), please sponsor the author.

Items to do:
------------
- check write permissions for source and destination pages
- use the group type of direct mail groups (fe_users, tt_address)
- integrate the bo_dmail_cat_mgr into the extension
- add Boris Feldmann as member in the bugtracker and for CVS
- add a benchmarking feature
- add a feature to only process n duplicates (in order to avoid timeouts)
- allow to (optionally) use subqueries from MySQL 4.1 to speed the search for cross-table duplicates up
- rework the UI to improve usability
- make the HTML output prettier
- make the FE output prettier (with and without debug mode)
- feature: check e-mail addresses for a MX entry for that domain
- investigate whether we can use TYPO3's feature to find subpages recursively (page->getMenu())
- if not records apply to an operation, display a message instead of a heading with nothing beneath it
- rework which items are checked by default and which aren't
- feature to merge contents from the different DB fields for duplicates
- don't use "" as e-mail address for the duplicate search
- remove < and > from around e-mail addresses
- document that the drop-down always jumps back to dryrun and that this is intended
- document the drop-down in Web > Functions -> Direct Mail Companion
- if the seminars extension is installed, rewire the attendance records if duplicates are deleted
- display which mode (dryrun/live) has been used
- after "live" mode, switch to "please select mode" instead of drydrun
- merge values (e.g. name, password, phone number etc.) from duplicate records
- if one fe_user record has a password and the other doesn't, keep the record with the password (or use the username from that record)
- test with PHP 5
- documentation: mention sponsorship (payment)
- use OElib
- change to getConfValue*/hasConfValue*
- test with TYPO3 4
- convert language files to XML
- move to the "partner" framework
